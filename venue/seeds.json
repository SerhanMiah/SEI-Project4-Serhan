    "description": "Disney’s Aladdin, a fabulous tale of daring, magic, deceitful sorcerers and hilarious genies, brings a whole new world to London’s West End.\r\n\r\nBased on the 1992 classic Academy Award-winning film, Disney’s Aladdin takes London audiences into a world filled with beauty, comedy and breath-taking spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe musical tells the well-known story of a savvy street urchin who finds himself caught up in the nefarious plans of an evil magician, falls for a stunning princess, and befriends a wonderfully funny lamp-dwelling magical being.\r\n\r\nAnd with three magical wishes made available by his new friend Genie, Aladdin has the chance to reinvent his persona completely. But in doing so, will he abandon what made him… Aladdin?\r\n\r\nIn 2010, renowned composer Alan Menken confirmed a musical adaptation of the movie was in the works. Four years later, the esteemed musical opened on Broadway, featuring much-loved songs including A Whole New World, Friend Like Me and Arabian Nights, along with new songs written especially for the stage production. Disney’s Aladdin finally transferred to the Prince Edward Theatre in London’s West End in the Summer of 2016.\r\n\r\nDisney’s Aladdin’s new music is penned by Menken and Howard Ashman, The Lion King’s Sir Tim Rice and Elf’s Chad Beguelin, who also wrote the book. Special effects are created by Jim Steinmeyer, the master illusionist who assisted David Copperfield.\r\n\r\nThe Olivier nominated and Tony Award-winning production is led by Matthew Croke in the title role, with former Sugababe and In The Heights star Jade Ewen as Princess Jasmine. Having provided many a scene-stealing turn in the New York production, Trevor Dion Nicholas plays Genie.\r\n\r\nWest End audiences can now delight in breathtaking sets, mind-blowing special effects and over 350 lavish costumes in this unmissable production directed and choreographed by The Book Of Mormon’s Casey Nicholaw.\r\n\r\nLooking for more about Disney’s Aladdin? Check out our ‘Everything You Need To Know’ about Disney’s Aladdin guide!\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re a teacher/careers advisor, Education Packs for this show (and more) are available in our Schools Resources area.\r\n\r\nLooking to see some musical theatre?
